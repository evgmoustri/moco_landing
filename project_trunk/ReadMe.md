### Grid convergence case

## Files

1. OpenSim_Models : Contains the OpenSim musculoskeletal model

2. Data : Contains kinematic data used as initial guess

3. Results : Stores results for every examined scenario  and comparative plots
   for all cases

## Scripts

1. predict_trunk_cases_effort.py : predict motion of single-leg landing 
   for different cases with modifications on the trunk joint 
   (flexion-extension, right,left-bending, internal,external rotation) 
   
2. compare_trunk_ben_left.py: plot and save comparative plots for trunk left 
   bending cases
   
3. compare_trunk_ben_right.py: plot and save comparative plots for trunk right 
   bending cases
   
4. compare_trunk_ext.py: plot and save comparative plots for trunk extension 
   cases
   
5. compare_trunk_flex.py: plot and save comparative plots for trunk flexion 
   cases
