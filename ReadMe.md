### Predictive simulation of single-leg landing scenarios for  ACL injury risk factors evaluation
Predictive simulations using the Moco OpenSim tool (and Gait2392 OpenSim 
musculoskeletal model) in order to predict multiple cases of single - leg 
landing motions

## Files

1. project_initial_cases : Folder that contains the analysis and 
   results regarding tracking a singles-leg landing motion from SCONE with 
   two musculoskeletal models of augmented complexity
   
2. project_grid_study : Folder that contains a convergence study in order to 
   find optimal number of intervals for the predictive analysis

3. project_height : Folder that contains the predictive analysis for 
   single-leg landing from multiple landing heights
   
4. project_hip : Folder that includes the predictive analysis for single-leg 
   landing motions with variations of the hip rotation (internal and 
   external rotation)
   
5. project_trunk : Folder that includes the predictive analysis for single -leg 
   landing motions with variations of the trunk orientation (flexion-extension, 
   right,left bending and internal,external rotation)
   
6. project_muscle_forces : Folder that contains the predictive analysis for 
   single-leg landings with permutations (strengthening or weakening) of  
   knee joint agonist-antagonist muscles 
   
7. project_effort : Folder that contains the predictive analysis for 
   multiple weights of the effort goal
