# MS plus FEM models - boundary conditions

+ Liukonnen2017
	+ Reference point at mid point between lat and med epic.
	+ 10% of both the internal - external moment of the knee joint and varus - valgus, this produced femoral rotations close to experimental data
	
+ Halonen2017
	+ Spring linear, useful values

+ Halonen2016 - (ACL reconstruction) varus - valgus, internal external moments 50% - they included the patella joint

+ Halonen16 - (Patella Importance) 
	+ see kladowski on how they performed the experiments
	+ same as before, 50% of moments since they included patella in their experiments
	+ linear springs, useful values for patellar ligaments

+ Adouni2012 
	+ 10-20% pssive internal - external moments

+ Tanska2015
	+ 10% internal external moment - no patella 

+ Ersafilan2020
	+ Reference point mid epicondylar axis
	+ Loadings:
		- Knee flexion angle
		- Muscle force vectors for each considered muscle
		- Residual force passing through the knee joint
		- Knee abduction - adduction and internal - external moment


	+ MS model estimated the JCF as a comb of muscle forces, inertial forxes and internal forces due to GRF
	+ The applied muscle forces directly to FEM, thus these were subtracted by the total JCF
	+ As Residual force they label the inertial forces and internal forces

	+ A good explanation is found on Supplementary Materials



# Landing pose

+ Soek Po Teng2020
    + Natural and fore-foot landings are better for force absorption compared to flat-foot landings
	+ landinigs:
	  - natural
	  - fore-foot
	  - flat-foot (1.4 times gigher max vGRF that fore-foot)
	  
+ Blackburn2008, Blackburn2009
    + effect of trunk flexion on :
	  - knee, hip kinematics
	  - landing forces and quadriceps activation
		
+ Saito2019
    + right leg landing from 40cm
	+ effect on knee angles and muscle activity
    + trunk in 5 cases :
	  - neutral
	  - flexion
	  - extension
	  - right bending (increased knee valgus)
	  - left bending
	  
+ Teng2017
    + how knee valgues is influenced by foot rotation potition
    + foot rotation potitions
	   - toe-in
	   - toe-forward
	   - toe-out



# Validation 

+ Wang2011
	 + Peak posterior and vertical ground reaction force,
	 + peak proximal tibia anterior and lateral shear forces
	 + Peak knee extension, valgus moment

+ Maniar2020
     + muscle force
	 + shear joint reaction force
	 + frontal plane joint reaction moment (varus-valgus)
